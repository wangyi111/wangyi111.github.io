Welcome to my home page! I'm currently a PhD candidate at Techincal University of Munich (TUM) under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaoxiang Zhu](https://www.lrg.tum.de/sipeo/team/zhu/) and [Dr. Conrad M Albrecht](https://conrad-m-albrecht.github.io/). My research focuses are self-/weakly-supervised machine learning techniques for remote sensing and Earth observation.
