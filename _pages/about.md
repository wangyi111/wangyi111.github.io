Welcome to my home page! I'm currently a PhD student at DLR & TUM under the supervision of [Dr. Conrad M Albrecht](https://www.lrg.tum.de/sipeo/team/dr-rer-nat-conrad-albrecht/) and [Prof. Xiaoxiang Zhu](https://www.lrg.tum.de/sipeo/team/zhu/). My research focuses are weakly-/un- supervised machine learning techniques for remote sensing and Earth observation.
